# Getting Started


Code Explanation
This project demonstrates a microservices architecture using Apache Kafka for event-driven communication between services. Here's a breakdown of how it works:
1. Order Processing Flow:

A customer places an order via the REST API (OrderController)
The OrderService processes the order and saves it to the database
The OrderService creates an OrderEvent and sends it to Kafka via OrderProducer
Both InventoryConsumer and NotificationConsumer pick up the event
The InventoryService updates product inventory levels
The NotificationService sends notifications to the customer

2. Key Components:

Models: Represent the data structures (Order, Product, OrderEvent)
Repositories: Interface with the database
Services: Contain business logic
Kafka Producer: Publishes order events to Kafka topics
Kafka Consumers: Subscribe to events and process them
Controller: REST API endpoints for client interaction

3. Kafka Integration:

Events are serialized as JSON when sent to Kafka
Multiple consumers process the same events independently
Error handling ensures system resilience
Topics are automatically created with appropriate partitioning

4. Database Integration:

Using H2 in-memory database for simplicity
JPA/Hibernate for ORM
Transaction management for data consistency

Project Benefits:

Decoupling: Services can evolve independently
Scalability: Easy to scale individual components
Resilience: Services can continue to function even if others fail
Performance: Asynchronous communication improves responsiveness

Resume Points:

Designed and implemented a microservices-based e-commerce application using Spring Boot and Apache Kafka
Created an event-driven architecture with producers and consumers for order processing, inventory management, and notifications
Implemented transaction management and error handling for system resilience
Set up Kafka topics, producers, and consumers with proper serialization/deserialization
Designed RESTful APIs for client interaction and system monitoring
Used Docker for containerization and simplified deployment

How to Customize:

Add Authentication: Integrate Spring Security for user authentication and authorization
Add Payment Processing: Create a payment service that listens to order events
Implement a User Interface: Create a frontend using React, Angular, or Vue
Add Monitoring: Integrate with Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring
Scale Up: Deploy to Kubernetes for production-grade scaling

This project showcases your ability to work with distributed systems, message brokers, and microservices architecture, which are highly valued skills in today's software development landscape.

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
